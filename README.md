WARNING:
Some antiviruses may false flag (false positive) it. Learn more about what false positive means here: https://www.huntress.com/cybersecurity-101/topic/false-positive-viruses
(False flag refers to a false positive, where antivirus incorrectly identifies a legitimate file or program as malicious. This can disrupt workflows, block essential applications, or cause unnecessary panic, even though no real threat exists, here it happens because the cheat alters game files.)

TUTORIAL (Important):
1. Click Tag, then click Release 
2. Download AstralisClient.exe
(If your browser or antivirus blocks it, disable the antivirus temporarily and download the file. Read why the antivirus does this above)
3. Open the game
4. Double click the .exe and wait for a few seconds before it injects. A notification will show up in the game when it does.
5. Enjoy the cheat!
